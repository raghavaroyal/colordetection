in this project I use the dataset is **https://github.com/codebrainz/color-names/blob/master/output/colors.csv**
to run the opencv files and pandas files we need a virtual environment.
to create a virtual environment i use vscode.
The command is --> '**python -m venv .env**'
the above command creates a virtual environment
after that update pip --> '**pip3 install --upgrade**'
to run the opencv file we need a library that library name is 'opencv-python' to import that library --> '**pip3 install opencv-python**'
to run the pandas file we need a library that library name is 'pandas' to import that library --> '**pip3 install pandas**'
